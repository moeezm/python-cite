# Python Citation Thingy
- It's really janky
- Can only do MLA
- Can do websites and books
- Can automatically get data from website (thanks to https://github.com/thenaterhood/python-autocite)
- Comes with inhouse testing mechanism that puts professional test suites to shame /s
- Written in Vim
- Supports multiple citations and generates a works cited page that follows the correct rules (probably the only redeeming factor but also the jankiest part)

## Lessons
**Learn Javascript**, seriously. This is currently only a library because I planned to make a frontend for it using HTML/CSS. However, because of my avoidance towards Javascript and because I had already written this in Python, I tried using a few ways to get Python to run in the browser. They all had their fair share of problems. Just learn Javascript.

**Use classes, or at the very least make your code clean**. I don't pretend to know the difference between different programming paradigms but this code is really not clean.
