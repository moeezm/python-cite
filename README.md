## Lessons
**Learn Javascript**, seriously. This is currently only a library because I planned to make a frontend for it using HTML/CSS. However, because of my avoidance towards Javascript and because I had already written this in Python, I tried using a few ways to get Python to run in the browser. They all had their fair share of problems. Just learn Javascript.
